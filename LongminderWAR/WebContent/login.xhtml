When was the time for the next dentist checkup? What calendar did I write it again?
<p>Longminder is a tool for long term reminders. Set an alert for some faraway point in the future and
when the time comes, you will get a friendly email reminder. Based on the settings you decide, you may
have to log on to the service and dismiss the alert, or it will be sent again a few days later.</p>
<h:outputText value="Apart from the emails concerning the service status, you will only be sent email based on the settings
you decide yourself." /><br />
<p>Some ideas:</p>
<ul><li>Biweekly reminder to start reading the book you have sitting on your shelf.</li>
<li>Reminder to rotate your bed mattress every 3 months.</li>
<li>Reminder every month to pay your recurring bills.</li>
<li>Yearly reminder to revise your long term investment strategy.</li>
<li>Yearly reminder for medical checkups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sign up and try!</p>

<h:outputText value="NB: This service is still a proof of concept and technical demo, so there is no guarantee that the
service is still up when your reminder would be sent. However, if the service has to be cancelled after it has entered beta stage,
all users will be sent an email about their alerts."></h:outputText><br />
<h:outputText value="NB2: The service is still in alpha stage, so it may have bugs and alerts may have to be cleared without warning" /><br />
